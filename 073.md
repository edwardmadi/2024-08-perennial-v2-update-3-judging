# `checkGroup()` does not take into account the position's PnL

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

Per the docs' provided in the contest:

> After the account owner has configured a rebalance group, keepers may call `Controller.checkGroup` offchain to determine if the group may be rebalanced. Assuming state does not change beforehand, the keeper may then call `Controller.rebalanceGroup` to perform a rebalance.

`checkGroup()` calls into `_queryMarketCollateral()`:

```solidity
    function checkGroup(address owner, uint256 group) public view returns (
        Fixed6 groupCollateral,
        bool canRebalance,
        Fixed6[] memory imbalances
    ) {
        // query owner's collateral in each market and calculate sum
        Fixed6[] memory actualCollateral;
        (actualCollateral, groupCollateral) = _queryMarketCollateral(owner, group);
        // ...
    }
```

`_queryMarketCollateral()` calls into `Market.locals()` to obtain the total collateral for each market.

```solidity
    function _queryMarketCollateral(address owner, uint256 group) private view returns (
        Fixed6[] memory actualCollateral,
        Fixed6 groupCollateral
    ) {
        actualCollateral = new Fixed6[](groupToMarkets[owner][group].length);
        for (uint256 i; i < actualCollateral.length; i++) {
            Fixed6 collateral = groupToMarkets[owner][group][i].locals(owner).collateral; // @audit this
            actualCollateral[i] = collateral;
            groupCollateral = groupCollateral.add(collateral);
        }
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-account/contracts/Controller.sol#L254

which returns the current collateral amount of a user's account at the current state

```solidity
    function locals(address account) external view returns (Local memory) {
        return _locals[account].read();
    }
```

Any price swings would've caused the position's PnL to settle, which would change the position's collaterals. Then an account would not be rebalanced even in case the market swing causes imbalance to the user's portfolio. When the position is not timely rebalanced and the risky position is not de-risked, liquidations can happen due to a position having low collateral.

## Impact

Keeper bots reliant on `checkGroup()` will not rebalance groups when needed. This could lead to liquidation due to the position not being timely de-risked with more collateral when needed.

Per the Sherlock rules:
> In case any of these incorrect values returned by the view functions are used as a part of a larger function which would result in loss of funds then it would be a valid medium/high depending on the impact.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Account for the PnL from the price differences as well when checking rebalancing possibility.
