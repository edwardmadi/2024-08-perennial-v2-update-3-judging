# Perennial account does not support ZKsync

## Summary

zkSync Era chain has differences in the usage of the create2 opcode compared to the EVM.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to contest Readme:

> On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?
> 
> Currently deployed to Arbitrum. Other EVM L2s are eligible but only Optimism Chains and Arbitrum are currently supported for gas pricing

However, perennial Account uses Openzepplin create2 to estimate address:

```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc IController
    function getAccountAddress(address owner) public view returns (address) {
        // calculate the hash for an uninitialized account for the owner
        return _computeCreate2Address(abi.encodeCall(Account.initialize, (owner)), SALT);
    }
```
```solidity
    function _computeCreate2Address(bytes memory data, bytes32 salt) internal view returns (address) {
        bytes memory bytecode = abi.encodePacked(
            type(BeaconProxy).creationCode,
            abi.encode(address(this), data)
        );
        return Create2.computeAddress(salt, keccak256(bytecode));
    }
```
The description of CREATE and CREATE2 (https://era.zksync.io/docs/reference/architecture/differences-with-ethereum.html#create-create2) states that Create cannot be used for arbitrary code unknown to the compiler.

## Impact

Controller will not work on ZKsync.
