# Manager.sol users can avoid keeper fees by overriding the order's maxFee

### Summary

in `Manager.sol#executeOrder()`
`keeper` executes the order without checking if `order.maxFee` has been modified (much less than expected)
A malicious user can avoid paying `keeper` by front-run and modify `order.maxFee=0`

### Root Cause

in [Manager.sol#L128](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-order/contracts/Manager.sol#L128)

When `keeper` executes an order, the maximum execution fee is: `order.maxFee`
At that time also the value of `orderId` can be modified by `placeOrder(orderId)`.
so that the user can front-run before the order is executed to change it (order.maxFee=0)
When `keeper` executes, keeper will lose this fee



### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. alice execute `placeOrder(orderId = 1 , maxFee = 10000)`
2. `keeper` monitors the order, and when the order meets the conditions and `order.maxFee` also meets expectations, submits the `executeOrder(orderId = 1 )` transaction
3. alice front run `placeOrder(orderId = 1 , maxFee = 0)` transaction.
4. `keeper` transaction starts executing `executeOrder(orderId = 1 )`. 
5. `keeper` gets fee 0 and loses 10000.

### Impact

`keeper' lost order execution fees

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

`executeOrder()` add `minFee`
```diff
-   function executeOrder(IMarket market, address account, uint256 orderId) external {
+   function executeOrder(IMarket market, address account, uint256 orderId , uint256 minOrderFee) external {
        // check conditions to ensure order is executable
        (TriggerOrder memory order, bool canExecute) = checkOrder(market, account, orderId);
        if (!canExecute) revert ManagerCannotExecuteError();
+       if (order.maxFee < minOrderFee) revert ManagerCannotExecuteError();

        _compensateKeeper(market, account, order.maxFee);
```
