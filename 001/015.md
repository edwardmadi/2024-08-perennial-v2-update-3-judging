# Anyone can be operator of any account due to lack of access control in `MarketFactory.updateExtension`

**Summary**
`MarketFactory.updateExtension` method allows to approve some address to be operator for all accounts. However, lack of access control allows anyone to call `updateExtension` with any address:
```solidity
    function updateExtension(address extension, bool newEnabled) external {
        extensions[extension] = newEnabled;
        emit ExtensionUpdated(extension, newEnabled);
    }
```

This means that any user can set his own address as extention, and then any `market.update` call on any account will pass the authorization check as valid operator, since `extensions[sender]` will be `true`:
```solidity
    function authorization(
        address account,
        address sender,
        address signer,
        address orderReferrer
    ) external view returns (bool isOperator, bool isSigner, UFixed6 orderReferralFee) {
        return (
            account == sender || extensions[sender] || operators[account][sender],
```

This allows any user to do whatever they want with the other users accounts (including opening/closing positions and withdrawing all collateral).


**Root Cause**
Lack of access control in `MarketFactory.updateExtension`:

**Internal pre-conditions**
None.

**External pre-conditions**
None.

**Attack Path**
1. Attacker calls `MarketFactory.updateExtension(attackerAddress, true)`
2. Attacker calls `market.update` on all active accounts, closing their positions and withdrawing all collateral, stealing all funds from the market.

**Impact**
All market collateral token balance is stolen.

**PoC**
Not needed

**Mitigation**
Add `onlyOwner` access control to `MarketFactory.updateExtension`.
