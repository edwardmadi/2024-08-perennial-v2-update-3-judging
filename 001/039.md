# No access control on `updateExtension()`, anyone can become a protocol-wide operator and change any positions at will

## Summary

`MarketFactory.updateExtension()` lacks access control, allowing anyone to become a protocol-wide operator and perform any position-based actions at will.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `MarketFactory.updateExtension()` does not have any access control, anyone can set themselves up as an authorized extension:

```solidity
function updateExtension(address extension, bool newEnabled) external { // @audit no access control
    extensions[extension] = newEnabled;
    emit ExtensionUpdated(extension, newEnabled);
}
```

When an address is set up as an extension, the check in `authorization` will always return true for `isOperator`.

```solidity
function authorization(
        address account,
        address sender,
        address signer,
        address orderReferrer
    ) external view returns (bool isOperator, bool isSigner, UFixed6 orderReferralFee) {
        return (
            account == sender || extensions[sender] || operators[account][sender], // @audit "extensions[sender]" will always make isOperator true
            account == signer || signers[account][signer],
            referralFees(orderReferrer)
        );
    }
```

This permission check is used in `InvariantLib.validate()` to ensure the order sent is permissioned:

```solidity
if (
            !updateContext.signer &&                                            // sender is relaying the account's signed intention
            !updateContext.operator &&                                          // sender is operator approved for account
            !(newOrder.isEmpty() && newOrder.collateral.gte(Fixed6Lib.ZERO))    // sender is depositing zero or more into account, without position change
        ) revert IMarket.MarketOperatorNotAllowedError(); // @audit will only revert if non-signer AND non-operator
``` 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial/contracts/libs/InvariantLib.sol#L78-L82

where the `updateContext` is loaded in `Market._loadUpdateContext()`, with `sender = msg.sender`.

```solidity
(updateContext.operator, updateContext.signer, updateContext.orderReferralFee) =
            IMarketFactory(address(factory())).authorization(context.account, msg.sender, signer, orderReferrer);
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial/contracts/Market.sol#L501-L502

which checks if `msg.sender` is an extension. In other words, protocol-wide extensions/operators can manipulate anyone's positions as will.

Because anyone can set themselves up as the extension due to the missing access control shown, then any sender can get authorized, and anyone's positions can be manipulated by anyone else.

From this permission, an attacker can:
- Grief other users by withdrawing their collateral or opening an extreme leverage position, pushing a liquidation that the attacker themselves may perform for profit.
- Open one-side positions for all users, generating an extreme funding rate, and profit off the funding fee by opening the opposite direction by themselves.

## Impact

Anyone to become a protocol-wide operator and manipulate any other users' positions, with various impacts leading to direct loss of funds (shown above).

## Recommendation

Add an access control restricting protocol-wide operators to admin only.
