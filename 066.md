# Emptyset reserve strategies may revert when aave/compound supply limit is reached or pool owner pause/froze the pool

### Summary

`CompoundV3FiatReserve` and `AaveV3FiatReserve` will interact with aave/compound pool each time new DSU token is minted/redeemed. This creates a single-point of failure. When the call to aave/compound fails, even if DSU protocol exposes only a portion of the risk to aave/compound, users are still unable to withdraw/deposit DSU. Since DSU reserves do not implement a proxy, such risk can be harmful to DSU and perennial protocol.

### Root Cause

In `CompoundV3FiatReserve.sol` and `AaveV3FiatReserve.sol`, function `_update()` will push/pull the imbalanced part of fiat token to/from Aave V3 or Compound V3. As almost every DSU mint/Redeem creates the imbalance, `_update()`is called everytime:

```solidity
    function _update(UFixed18 collateral, UFixed18 target) internal override {
        if (collateral.gt(target))
            compound.withdraw(fiat, UFixed6Lib.from(collateral.sub(target)));
        if (target.gt(collateral))
            compound.supply(fiat, UFixed6Lib.from(target.sub(collateral)));
    }
```
```solidity
    function _update(UFixed18 collateral, UFixed18 target) internal virtual override {
        if (collateral.gt(target))
            aave.withdraw(fiat, UFixed6Lib.from(collateral.sub(target)), address(this));
        if (target.gt(collateral))
            aave.deposit(fiat, UFixed6Lib.from(target.sub(collateral)), address(this), 0);
    }
```

However, Such logic creates a single-point of failure: if the call to aave/compound fails, no DSU can get minted and no DSU can get redeemed.

Here are some possible scenarios:

1. Aave v3 and Compound V3 may reach deposit limit:
https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L80-L87
https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/blob/2fc94d987ebd46572da93a3323b67c5d27642b1b/contracts/CometConfiguration.sol#L47

Currently, Aave Ethereum USDT market now accounts for 64.68% of the supply cap, Aave Ethereum USDC market now accounts for 66.98% of the supply cap. When market utilization increases, Aave/Compound users are incentivized to supply into the market, and is possible to reach the supply limit.

2. Aave v3 and Compound V3 may get paused or retired:
https://github.com/compound-finance/comet/blob/2fc94d987ebd46572da93a3323b67c5d27642b1b/contracts/Comet.sol#L865
https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/master/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L77

In Nov 2023, [Aave paused several markets after reports of feature issue](https://cointelegraph.com/news/aave-pauses-several-markets-feature-issue) .

Commonly in lending platforms, when a certain token or lending pool has been deemed to be too risky or have been hacked, it is retired. This has happened multiple times in Aave, with some other examples below:

GHST borrowing disabled on polygon
agEUR borrowing disabled on polygon
UST disabled on Venus protocol on BSC
SXP disabled on Venus protocol on BSC
TRXOld disabled on Venus protocol on BSC

### Internal pre-conditions

No internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

Aave governance/admin pause/freeze the pool or aave/compound supply cap reached.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker can make proposals to aave/compound governance.
2. Whales can DoS DSU protocol by deposit into aave/compound to reach the supply cap.
3. Aave/compound markets may retire and a new one can be deployed. However DSU reserve contracts are immutable.

### Impact

Emptyset reserve strategies can be a single-point of failure.
1. Aave/compound governance can DoS DSU protocol, which efficiently DoS perennial protocol because no DSU can be minted and redeemed.
2. When aave/compound supply cap is reached, DSU protocol will suffer a DoS.
3. All related perennial accounts cannot work normally.


### PoC

No need.

### Mitigation

Consider set `_update` in a try-catch block, and add a way for Admin/Coordinator to mannually rebalance reserves.
