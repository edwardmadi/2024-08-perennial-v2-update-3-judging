# `OPT_GAS.getL1GasUsed` is deprecated as of Fjord update

### Summary

Optimisim Fjoid upgrade introduces a new [L1 Gas Usage Estimation](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/fjord/predeploys.html#l1-gas-usage-estimation) formula, and current `getL1GasUsed` is deprecated and will be removed.

### Root Cause


In `Kept_Optimism.sol:21`, `OPT_GAS.getL1GasUsed()` is used to computes the amount of L1 gas used for a transaction.

According to [Optimism spec](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/fjord/predeploys.html#l1-gas-usage-estimation):

> The getL1GasUsed method is deprecated as of Fjord because it does not capture that there are two kinds of gas being consumed due to the introduction of blobs. This function will revert when called in a future upgrade.
>
> Users can continue to use the getL1Fee method to estimate the L1 fee for a given transaction, or the new getL1FeeUpperBound method introduced by Fjord as a lower gas alternative.

And from https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/packages/contracts-bedrock/src/L2/GasPriceOracle.sol#L165 :

```solidity
    /// @custom:deprecated This method does not accurately estimate the gas used for a transaction.
    ///                    If you are calculating fees use getL1Fee or getL1FeeUpperBound.
    function getL1GasUsed(bytes memory _data) public view returns (uint256) {
        ...
```

Fjord updates the L1 cost calculation function to use a FastLZ-based compression estimator. The L1 cost is computed as:

`l1FeeScaled = l1BaseFeeScalar*l1BaseFee*16 + l1BlobFeeScalar*l1BlobBaseFee`
`estimatedSizeScaled = max(minTransactionSize * 1e6, intercept + fastlzCoef*fastlzSize)`
`l1Fee = estimatedSizeScaled * l1FeeScaled / 1e12`

However, `L1GasUsed` is not capturing the L1 blob gas used by a transaction.

### Internal pre-conditions

Protocol will be deployed on Optimism chains.(OP mainnet or Base mainnet)

### External pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions, since Fjoid was activated on Wed Jul 10 16:00:01 UTC 2024:

### Attack Path

No attack path. The function is called in `_handleKeeperFee` everytime when a keeper relays a message.

### Impact

`OPT_GAS.getL1GasUsed()` is deprecated now. Using this fuction will lead to incorrect l1fee estimation, and will revert in a future upgrade.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `getL1FeeUpperBound` or `getL1Fee` instead.
