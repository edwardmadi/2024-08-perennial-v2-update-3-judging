# User will not be able to withdraw their assets from the vault if their share drops below minDeposit

### Summary

There is a check that redeeming shares should not be less than minDeposit in assets amount. This means that their assets will be taken by protocol.

### Root Cause

```solidity
        if (!redeemShares.isZero() && context.latestCheckpoint.toAssets(redeemShares).lt(context.parameter.minDeposit))
            revert VaultInsufficientMinimumError();
```

The impact depends on minDeposit values sets by protocol, maybe its 0$, 10$, 100$

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow withdrawal if it's all their assets left.
