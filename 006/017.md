# `MultiInvoker` and `Manager` operations might revert due to assumption of 1 `DSU` = 1 `USDC`

**Summary**
Both `MultiInvoker` and `Manager` assume that `DSU` tokens convert to `USDC` tokens in 1:1 ratio when unwrapping `DSU` (the amount redeemed and amount pushed to receiver is the same):
```solidity
    reserve.redeem(amount);
    if (receiver != address(this)) USDC.push(receiver, UFixed6Lib.from(amount));
```

The issue is that `reserve` implementation allows for redeem price to be below 1:
```solidity
    function redeemPrice() public view returns (UFixed18) {
        // if overcollateralized, cap at 1:1 redemption / if undercollateralized, redeem pro-rata
        return assets().unsafeDiv(dsu.totalSupply()).min(UFixed18Lib.ONE);
    }
```

In particular, there are some scenarios identified (see below) when the amount of `USDC` redeemed is less than amount of `DSU`, thus all unwrap attempts in `MultiInvoker` and `Manager` will revert when trying to send more `USDC` than the contract has from redeem operation. This causes all user orders execution to be temporarily blocked until the redeem price increases to 1:1 again, and delayed orders execution causes loss of funds for the users, since they can be executed at the price much worse than specified by the user.

All `MultiInvoker` and `Manager` withdrawals with unwrap flag set are vulnerable to this DOS. Each `MultiInvoker` or `Manager` action charges `interfaceFee` by withdrawing it from user's market balance and if `unwrap` flag is set, it's converted to USDC via `batcher` or `reserve` (if `batcher` is not set or empty). Since this conversion to USDC will revert in `reserve`, entire `MultiInvoker` or `Manager` transaction will revert as well.

**Root Cause**
`MultiInvoker` charges interface fee in `_update`:

`_chargeFee` unwraps `DSU` if `unwrap` is set to `true`:

`_unwrap` redeems from reserve:

`redeem` uses `redeemPrice()` to calculate amount of `USDC` to send:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/main/emptyset-mono/packages/emptyset-reserve/contracts/reserve/ReserveBase.sol#L109

`redeemPrice()` can be below 1:

**Internal pre-conditions**
1. Reserve uses either AAVE or Compound strategy
2. Admin has just activated the strategy (has set `Reserve.allocation` greather than 0) or has just issued all surplus amount from AAVE/Compound (has called `Reserve.issue`).
3. User has created a `MultiInvoker` or `Manager` order with `interfaceFee.unwrap` or `interfaceFee2.unwrap` set to true.

**External pre-conditions**
Market price is within the order's execution range

**Attack Path**
Happens by itself
1. Any user deposits or redeems anything to/from `DSU` (this triggers allocation to AAVE/Compound, which reduces `DSU` assets by at least 1 wei or more due to rounding error in the AAVE/Compound pool favor). Now the `DSU` has less `assets` than `totalSupply`
2. Any order execution in `MultiInvoker` or `Manager` will revert, because the amount of `USDC` received will be at least 1 wei less than amount of `DSU` redeemed.

**Impact**
- User order is executed at a worse price
- Or position is liquidated (in case the order was a stop-loss and price moved beyound liquidation price)
- Or user order is not executed (in case the order is take profit and the price had moved away from the execution range)

In all 3 cases user losses funds.

**PoC**
Not needed

**Mitigation**
`Reserve.redeem` returns the amount of `USDC` redeemed - use this instead of original `amount` when sending `USDC`.
