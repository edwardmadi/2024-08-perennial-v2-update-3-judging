# The `RiskParameter.liquidationFee` variable is not treated and validated as a percentage value, leading to breaking protocol invariants.

## Summary

In Perennial v2.2, the `RiskParameter.liquidationFee` variable held a fixed amount. In Perennial v2.3, it became a percentage value. However, this change is not fully reflected in the code.

In `RiskParameterStorageLib`, it is incorrectly validated and compared to fixed values from the `ProtocolParameter` struct, leading to incorrect assumptions, particularly regarding the protocol-wide `maxFeeAbsolute` setting, as well as per-market `minMaintenance` values.

## Vulnerability Detail

As stated in the README in the section, *"Please list any known issues and explicitly state the acceptable risks for each known issue."*:

```text
Coordinators are given broad control over the parameters of the markets they coordinate. The protocol parameter is designed to prevent situations where parameters are set to maliciously steal funds. If the coordinator can operate within the bounds of reasonable protocol parameters to negatively affect markets, we would like to know about it.
```

There is theoretically no limitation on the `liquidationFee` value. The liquidation fee that can be paid by the account can exceed the `maxFeeAbsolute` value, breaking assumptions and negatively affecting the markets.

For example, if the `maxFeeAbsolute` value is set to $50, then the `liquidationFee` can be up to 5000% of the settlement fee, calculated using this equation:

```solidity
File: VersionLib.sol
246:     function _accumulateLiquidationFee(
247:         Version memory next,
248:         VersionAccumulationContext memory context
249:     ) private pure returns (UFixed6 liquidationFee) {
250:         liquidationFee = context.toOracleVersion.valid ?
251:@>           context.toOracleReceipt.settlementFee.mul(context.riskParameter.liquidationFee) :
252:             UFixed6Lib.ZERO;
```

Here are the places where the `liquidationFee` percentage value is incorrectly validated against fixed values:

```solidity
File: RiskParameter.sol
139:         if (self.liquidationFee.gt(protocolParameter.maxFeeAbsolute)) revert RiskParameterStorageInvalidError();
```

```solidity
File: RiskParameter.sol
155:         if (self.minMaintenance.lt(self.liquidationFee)) revert RiskParameterStorageInvalidError();
```

## Impact

- Coordinators can negatively affect markets while operating within the bounds of reasonable protocol parameters.

## Tool Used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The protocol-wide `maxFeeAbsolute` value needs to be enforced across the markets. The `liquidationFee` should be validated as a percentage value.
