# Uninitialized Ownership in Contract Constructor Leads to Unauthorized Control

## Summary

The contract ownership is not being set correctly which means that the wrong person or entity might have control over the contract leading to unintended changes and actions being taken without the owner's permission.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract  constructor does not  properly set the owner allowing anyone to claim ownership and control the contract  because the ownership is not correctly initialized.

## Impact

Unintended users can take control of the contract making unauthorized changes and decisions leading to unexpected behavior and outcomes.
