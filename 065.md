# DSU redeemer lack of slippage protection leads to unpredictable redeem amount

## Summary
The function `ReserveBase.redeemPrice()` returns `min(Total assets / DSU supply, 1)`. This function is used by [`ReserveBase._redeem(UFixed18)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/main/emptyset-mono/packages/emptyset-reserve/contracts/reserve/ReserveBase.sol#L109) to calculate the amount of the underlying asset received for the amount redeemed.

If for any reason $\frac{\text{Total assets}}{\text{DSU supply}} < 1$, users who send a transaction expecting to receive a certain amount of assets may be exposed to a worse exchange rate due to the effects of other transactions included before theirs.

## Vulnerability Detail
`ReserveBase.redeem(UFixed18)` does not allow users to specify a minimum amount to receive.

## Impact
If `ReserveBase.redeemPrice() < UFixed18Lib.ONE`, users may be exposed to receiving a worse exchange rate for DSU redemption than expected.

## POC
In case Aave/Compound gets compromised, old deposits could be redeemed at a worse exchange rate. For example, 1 USDC deposited on day X might redeem for less than 1 USDC on day Y, such as `0.98`.

Assuming an allocation percentage of 80%, this means users will receive`(1 * 0.2 + 0.98 * 0.80)/100 =0.984` per DSU

If Alice wants to redeem 1000 DSU at moment `Y - 1`, she would expect to receive 1000 USDC. She submits a transaction calling`ReserveBase.redeem(1000e18)`, but her transaction gets delayed in the mempool and is executed at moment `Y+1`, resulting in her receiving only 984 USDC instead of 1000 USDC.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Allow DSU redeemers to specify a minimum amount of funds to receive
```diff
-  function redeem(UFixed18 amount) external returns (UFixed18 redemptionAmount) {
+  function redeem(UFixed18 amount, UFixed18 minRedemption) external returns (UFixed18 redemptionAmount) {
        dsu.pull(msg.sender, amount);
        redemptionAmount = _redeem(amount);
+     require(redemptionAmount  > minRedemption);
        _allocate(redemptionAmount);
        _push(redemptionAmount);
    }
```
