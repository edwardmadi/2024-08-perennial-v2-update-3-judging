# `MultiInvoker`, `Manager` and `Account` unexpected reverts in certain conditions due to AAVE reverting on deposits and withdrawals with 0 amount

**Summary**
AAVE v3 pool implementation reverts when trying to deposit or withdraw `amount = 0`:
```solidity
  function validateSupply(DataTypes.ReserveCache memory reserveCache, uint256 amount)
    internal
    view
  {
    require(amount != 0, Errors.INVALID_AMOUNT);
```

`AaveV3FiatReserve._update` still allows deposits to and withdrawals from AAVE with `amount = 0`:
```solidity
    function _update(UFixed18 collateral, UFixed18 target) internal virtual override {
        if (collateral.gt(target))
            aave.withdraw(fiat, UFixed6Lib.from(collateral.sub(target)), address(this));
        if (target.gt(collateral))
            aave.deposit(fiat, UFixed6Lib.from(target.sub(collateral)), address(this), 0);
    }
```

Note, that when `abs(collateral - target) < 1e12`, conversion from UFixed18 to UFixed6 will result in `amount = 0`.

All amounts relevant for this issue are calculated from 6-decimals amounts (unallocated amount is balance of 6-decimals USDC token, allocated amount is balance of 6-decimals aUSDC token, redeemed/deposited amount is UFixed6 in `MultiInvoker`, `Manager` and `Account`), however the `target` value is calculated as:
```solidity
        target = unallocated.add(allocated).sub(amount).mul(allocation);
```
Since `unallocated`, `allocated` and `amount` all will be converted from 6 to 18 decimals - all of them will be divisible by 1e12. But target amount will very likely **not** be divisible by 1e12. For example, `unallocated + allocated - amount = 111e12`, `allocation = 10% = 0.1e18 = 1e17`, then `target = 111e12 * 1e17 / 1e18 = 111e11 = 11.1e12`.

This means that `collateral` will almost always be either greater or less, but not equal to `target`.

Now, the situation when `abs(collateral - target) < 1e12` might happen:
- In `Account`: almost always when user calls `withdraw(UFixed6Lib.MAX, true)` and `Account` `DSU` balance is 0.
- In `MultiInvoker` and `Manager`: if the allocated amount (aUSDC) grows by exactly the user's order amount over the time without transactions
- or if admin changes allocation percentage and order's amount matches the difference between collateral and new target exactly

The most likely situation is in the `Account`: when user tries to withdraw full amount in USDC (setting `unwrap = true`) (either directly from `Account` or with signature via `Controller`), and the account doesn't have any `DSU` (only `USDC`), such transactions will almost always revert, denying the user core protocol functionality. This might be time-critical for the user as he might need these funds elsewhere and the unexpected reverts (which will keep happening in consecutive transactions) might make him lose funds from the positions opened or not opened elsewhere.

Much less likely condition for `MultiInvoker` and `Manager`: withdrawals with unwrap flag set are vulnerable to this DOS. `MultiInvoker` or `Manager` action charges `interfaceFee` by withdrawing it from user's market balance and if `unwrap` flag is set, it's converted to USDC via `batcher` or `reserve` (if `batcher` is not set or empty). Since this conversion to USDC will revert in `reserve`, entire `MultiInvoker` or `Manager` transaction will revert as well.

**Root Cause**
`AaveV3FiatReserve._update` doesn't verify `amount` passed to `aave.deposit` and `aave.withdraw` is not 0.

**Internal pre-conditions**
1. Reserve uses AAVE strategy
2. `Reserve.allocation` is not 0
3. `(allocated + unallocated - interfaceFee.amount) * reserve.allocation` is not divisible by 1e12.

`Account`:
4a. User's account has some `USDC` and none `DSU`
5a. User calls `Account.withdraw(UFixed6Lib.MAX, true)`

`MultiInvoker` and `Manager`:
4b. User has created a `MultiInvoker` or `Manager` order with `interfaceFee.unwrap` or `interfaceFee2.unwrap` set to true.
5b. The allocated amount in reserve has grown exactly by the amount charged by interface over the time without transactions

**External pre-conditions**
`Account`: None

`MultiInvoker` and `Manager`: Market price is within the order's execution range

**Attack Path**
Happens by itself:
- `Account` user: all such withdrawal transactions will revert denying user withdrawal of his funds (the funds can still be withdrawn if unwrap is set to `false`, or exact `amount` is specified, but if it's another contract, this might not be possible at all).
- `MultiInvoker`/`Manager`: user's order can not be executed temporarily due to revert.

**Impact**
`Account`: User is unable to withdraw his funds and can not allocate them in the other positions, losing funds from liquidation or not benefiting from the position he intended to open.

`MultiInvoker` / `Manager`:
- User order is executed at a worse price
- Or position is liquidated (in case the order was a stop-loss and price moved beyound liquidation price)
- Or user order is not executed (in case the order is take profit and the price had moved away from the execution range)

**PoC**
Not needed

**Mitigation**
Convert difference of `target` and `collateral` to `Fixed6` and compare it to 0, instead of directly comparing `target` with `collateral` in AAVE strategy.
