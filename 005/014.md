# Anyone can steal all funds from the `market` due to lack of account health accounting for pending pnl from difference of intent price and market price.

**Summary**
When user opens position from signed intent, pending orders are created for 2 accounts (intent taker and maker) with user-specified price. Upon settlement, there is some pnl realized to both accounts due to difference of intent price and market price. The intent price is specified by the user and can be any number (like 0 or billions), creating huge profit for one account and huge loss for the other. The issue is that this pnl is not accounted for in account health at the time of order creation (only at the time of order settlement), meaning that any price is allowed, and then during settlement a huge bad debt can be created in one account, with the same profit in the other, allowing attacker to steal all funds from the `market`.

**Root Cause**
Intent `price` is only used in `Guarantee.notional`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial/contracts/types/Guarantee.sol#L71

And the only time when `Guarantee.notional` is used is during settlement (when accumulating checkpoint collateral):
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial/contracts/libs/CheckpointLib.sol#L222

Since settlement happens some time after the order is placed (not in the same transaction with adding order) and order can not be cancelled, this means that any intent price is accepted by the protocol without any checks (other than storage limitations).

**Internal pre-conditions**
None.

**External pre-conditions**
None.

**Attack Path**
Since intents can be easily created by any user, there are no pre-conditions for the attack. The scenario is as following:
- Attacker deposits some collateral into `account1` and `account2`
- Attacker signs intent with a small position (like `10`) and a price of `125000000` (or any other huge price) from `account1`
- Attacker uses `account2` to calls `market.update` with the signed intent from `account1`
- After the first settlement, one account has a loss of `10 * (125000000 - currentPrice)` (huge bad debt), and the other account is in the same profit (higher than total market collateral).
- Attacker withdraws all funds which `market` has.

**Impact**
All market collateral token balance is stolen.

There are also additional smaller impacts possible, such as:
- `collateralization` limit provided by user is verified incorrectly: it's verified at the time of order submission using the latest oracle price, disregarding the intent price, meaning that after settlement it can be way worse than user specified.
- user's account is bricked if the intent notional is close to int64.max/min (when trying to settle, this notional is added to user collateral, and collateral can overflow int64, reverting storage verification).
- maybe more

**PoC**
Add to `test/unit/Market.test.ts` in the `signer` context:
```solidity

    factory.parameter.returns({

    const marketParameter = { ...(await market.parameter()) }
    marketParameter.takerFee = parse6decimal('0.01')
    await market.updateParameter(marketParameter)

    const riskParameter = { ...(await market.riskParameter()) }

    const EXPECTED_PNL = parse6decimal('10') // position * (125-123)

    verifier.verifyIntent.returns()

        [

        ](userC.address, intent, DEFAULT_SIGNATURE);

    oracle.at
    .whenCalledWith(ORACLE_VERSION_2.timestamp)
    .returns([ORACLE_VERSION_2, { ...INITIALIZED_ORACLE_RECEIPT, settlementFee: SETTLEMENT_FEE }])

    oracle.request.whenCalledWith(user.address).returns()

    await settle(market, user)
    await settle(market, userB)
    await settle(market, userC)

    var loc = await market.locals(user.address);
    console.log("user collateral: " + loc.collateral);
    var pos = await market.positions(user.address);
    console.log("user pos: long = " + pos.long);
    var pending = await market.pendingOrders(user.address, 1);

    var pending = await market.pendingOrders(userC.address, 1);
    console.log("pending: short = " + pending.shortPos + " collateral = " + pending.collateral);
})
```

Console output:
```solidity
user collateral: -624989391154680
user pos: long = 5000000
pending: long = 5000000 collateral = 10000000000
userC collateral: 625009384745320
userC pos: short = 5000000
pending: short = 5000000 collateral = 10000000000
```

**Mitigation**
The `InvariantLib.validate` should include guarantee notional in position health calculation (based on the latest oracle price). Additionally, I also suggest to limit the intent price to the latest oracle price +- 10% or so for sanity check as there might be the other attack vectors utilizing tiny positions with huge/low price and notional (possible overflow/underflow etc).
