# protocol accounting is broken due to not substracting subtractiveFee, solverFee

### Summary

Users pay all protocol fees, which are deducted from their positions when they make trades. However, they do not pay referral fees or solver fees; instead, the protocol covers those costs.

### Root Cause

All fees should be subtracted from users account, so there is this code which update local position
```solidity
    function _response(
        CheckpointAccumulationResult memory result
    ) private pure returns (CheckpointAccumulationResponse memory response) {
        response.collateral = result.collateral
            .add(result.priceOverride)
            .sub(Fixed6Lib.from(result.tradeFee))
            .sub(result.offset)
            .sub(Fixed6Lib.from(result.settlementFee));
        response.liquidationFee = result.liquidationFee;
        response.subtractiveFee = result.subtractiveFee;
        response.solverFee = result.solverFee;
    }
```

Later there is an additional `accumulation.liquidationFee` substraction here

```solidity
    function update(
        Local memory self,
        uint256 newId,
        CheckpointAccumulationResponse memory accumulation
    ) internal pure {
        self.collateral = self.collateral.add(accumulation.collateral).sub(Fixed6Lib.from(accumulation.liquidationFee));
        self.latestId = newId;
    }
```
[perennial-v2/packages/perennial/contracts/types/Local.sol#L52](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial/contracts/types/Local.sol#L52)

The subtractiveFee and solver fees are not accounted for anywhere inside `CheckpointLib` like other fees, which leads to a situation where the coins in the market will not match the sum of local accounts.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Broken accounting will lead to someone being unable to retrieve their funds. Whether itâ€™s a user, liquidator, referral, or the protocol, they may not receive their funds due to the accounting issue.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
    function _response(
        CheckpointAccumulationResult memory result
    ) private pure returns (CheckpointAccumulationResponse memory response) {
        response.collateral = result.collateral
            .add(result.priceOverride)
            .sub(Fixed6Lib.from(result.tradeFee))
            .sub(result.offset)
            .sub(Fixed6Lib.from(result.settlementFee))
+            .sub(Fixed6Lib.from(result.subtractiveFee))
+            .sub(Fixed6Lib.from(result.solverFee));
        response.liquidationFee = result.liquidationFee;
        response.subtractiveFee = result.subtractiveFee;
        response.solverFee = result.solverFee;
    }
```
