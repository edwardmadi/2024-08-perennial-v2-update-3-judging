# Market coordinator can set proportional and adiabatic fees much higher than limited by protocol due to fixed point truncation

**Summary**
The README states the following:
> Q: Please list any known issues and explicitly state the acceptable risks for each known issue.
Coordinators are given broad control over the parameters of the markets they coordinate. The protocol parameter is designed to prevent situations where parameters are set to malicious steal funds. If the coordinator can operate within the bounds of reasonable protocol parameters to negatively affect markets we would like to know about it

Market coordinator can set `scale` for `takerFee` or `makerFee` at amount significantly lower than the validated `scaleLimit` due to truncation when storing the parameter. This will lead to much higher proportional and adiabatic fees than max amount intended by the protocol. Example:
- `protocolParameter.minScale = 50%`
- `protocolParameter.minEfficiency = 100%`
- This means that coordinator must not set `scale` less than `50%` of `makerLimit`, meaning max proportional fee is 2x the `takerFee.proportionalFee`
- Coordinator sets risk parameter: `makerLimit = 3.9 WBTC`, `takerFee.scale = 1.95 WBTC`, this is validated correctly (`scale` is `50%` of `makerLimit`)
- However when it's stored, both `makerLimit` and `takerFee.scale` are truncated to integer numbers, storing `makerLimit = 3`, `takerFee.scale = 1` (meaning `scale` is 33% of `makerLimit`, breaking the protocol enforced ratio, and charging `x1.5` higher proportional fee to takers)

**Internal pre-conditions**
- Malicious market coordinator
- Market with high-price token (such as BTC), `makerLimit` is not very high but still resonable (e.g. `3.9 WBTC` which is a reasonable limit of $200K+).

**External pre-conditions**
None.

**Attack Path**
1. Coordinator sets correct `makerLimit` and `scale` at the edge of allowed protocol parameter (but both slightly below integer amount)
2. Both `makerLimit` and `scale` pass validation, but are truncated when stored
3. At this point the protocol enforced ratio is broken and actual fee charged to users is much higher (up to 1.5x) than intended by the protocol

**Impact**
Users pay up to 1.5x higher taker/maker proportional fee or adiabatic fee

**PoC**
Not needed.

**Mitigation**
Truncate both `makerLimit` and all `scale`s before validating them (or do not truncate at all as more than integer precision might be required for high-price token markets)
