# An Attacker can Cancel Any Accounts Group thus DoSing Supposed Valid Txns

### Summary

When cancelling a group or a nonce in VerifierBase.sol, not checking whether the signer is allowed to sign signatures for the account, enables an attacker to sign and cancel any nonce or group for the account at will, thus DoSing user actions due to reverting signatures

### Root Cause


Perennial contracts have a concept that allows approved parties to perform certain operations using signatures in place of an account. 
The verification of these signatures is done via different verifier contracts, namely [OrderVerifier](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/ac46a2fc8baf6c827ee20c69eecae66561a5c65f/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-order/contracts/OrderVerifier.sol#L13), [AccountVerifier](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/ac46a2fc8baf6c827ee20c69eecae66561a5c65f/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-account/contracts/AccountVerifier.sol#L23) and [Verifier](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/ac46a2fc8baf6c827ee20c69eecae66561a5c65f/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-verifier/contracts/Verifier.sol#L24) contracts, all of these contracts are used as verifiers for different perennial contracts but they all inherit from [VerifierBase](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/ac46a2fc8baf6c827ee20c69eecae66561a5c65f/root/contracts/verifier/VerifierBase.sol#L10) contract.

Perennial also has a concept of groups and nonces, each signed signature is assigned to a group and a nonce, one group could have up to x amount of nonces, and since during signature verification, the assigned group is checked to be a valid group, this allows the account owner to easily cancel a bunch of signatures by simply cancelling the group via a call to [VerifierBase::cancelGroup](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/ac46a2fc8baf6c827ee20c69eecae66561a5c65f/root/contracts/verifier/VerifierBase.sol#L44-L46) function.

But currently, an issue exists in the base contract that could allow an attacker to cancel an account linked signatures to a group deliberately, this will thus DoS the target account signature updates from the respective contracts. For example, the owner account or the delegated signer calling [manager::placeOrderWithSignature](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/ac46a2fc8baf6c827ee20c69eecae66561a5c65f/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-order/contracts/Manager.sol#L81-L88) or [cancelOrderWithSignature](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/ac46a2fc8baf6c827ee20c69eecae66561a5c65f/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-order/contracts/Manager.sol#L96-L103) functions with a signature using a cancelled group will result in a revert.

### Attack Path

Here's the GroupCancellation struct:

```solidity
struct GroupCancellation {
    /// @dev The group to cancel
    uint256 group;

    /// @dev The common information for EIP712 actions
    Common common;
}
```
and the Common struct:
```solidity
struct Common {
    /// @dev The target account of the message (usually the account on behalf of which the action is being performed)
    address account;
    /// @dev EOA signing the message (usually either the account or a delegate of the account)
    address signer;
    /// @dev ensures the message is unique to a particular protocol version, chain, and verifier
    address domain;
    /// @dev per-sender nonce which is automatically cancelled upon validation
    uint256 nonce;
    /// @dev per-sender nonce which must be manually cancelled with a GroupCancellation message
    uint256 group;
    /// @dev prevents this message from having the intended effect after a specified timestamp
    uint256 expiry;
}
```
Assuming the target account is Alice's account and the target group is group 8. The attacker will construct and sign a signature with `group` set to 8, `account` set to Alice's address, `signer` and `domain` set to his address, and `nonce` set to a random not yet utilized nonce.
The attacker will then call [VerifierBase::cancelGroupWithSignature](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/ac46a2fc8baf6c827ee20c69eecae66561a5c65f/root/contracts/verifier/VerifierBase.sol#L54-L57) function, with the above GroupCancellation params and the signed signature. The signature validity check [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/ac46a2fc8baf6c827ee20c69eecae66561a5c65f/root/contracts/verifier/VerifierBase.sol#L27-L36), will pass since the attacker is the signer.
[_cancelGroup](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/ac46a2fc8baf6c827ee20c69eecae66561a5c65f/root/contracts/verifier/VerifierBase.sol#L70-L73) will then be called, with Alice's address as account and the group as 8:
```solidity
    function _cancelGroup(address account, uint256 group) private {
        groups[account][group] = true;
        emit GroupCancelled(account, group);
    }
```


### Impact

Can cancel any accounts group and nonce in all the verifier contracts inheriting from [VerifierBase](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/ac46a2fc8baf6c827ee20c69eecae66561a5c65f/root/contracts/verifier/VerifierBase.sol#L10), thus DoSing supposed valid actions.

### Mitigation

Check that the signer is authorized to sign transactions for the account.
```solidity
  function _ensureValidSigner(address account, address signer) internal view {
        if (account != signer && !marketFactory.signers(account, signer)) revert ManagerInvalidSignerError();
    }
```
Note that, the same check should also be added to [VerifierBase::cancelNonceWithSignature](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/ac46a2fc8baf6c827ee20c69eecae66561a5c65f/root/contracts/verifier/VerifierBase.sol#L49-L51) function
