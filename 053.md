# Corrupted storage after upgrade in the `MarketFactory` contract.

## Summary

The old `MarketFactory` is meant to be upgraded to a new implementation. The problem is that a new `extensions` mapping was added between currently occupied storage slots. After the upgrade, the newly upgraded smart contract would be reading from storage slots that contain data no longer corresponding to the new storage layout. This would cause the system to break in an unpredictable manner, depending on the number of storage slots added as part of the upgrade.

## Vulnerability Detail

As seen in the old storage layout:

```solidity
    IFactory public immutable oracleFactory;
    ProtocolParameterStorage private _parameter;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) public operators;
    mapping(IOracleProvider => mapping(address => IMarket)) private _markets;
    mapping(address => UFixed6) public referralFee;
```

And the new storage layout:

```solidity
    IFactory public immutable oracleFactory;
    IVerifier public immutable verifier;
    ProtocolParameterStorage private _parameter;
@>  mapping(address => bool) public extensions;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) public operators;
    mapping(IOracleProvider => mapping(address => IMarket)) private _markets;
    mapping(address => UFixed6) private _referralFees;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) public signers;
```

The storage will be corrupted after the upgrade because the new `extensions` mapping was introduced between already populated slots. The `extensions`, `operators`, `_markets`, and `_referralFees` will read and write to incorrect slots.

## Impact

- Corrupted storage of the `MarketFactory` contract.
- System would break in an unpredictable manner.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Place the `extensions` mapping after the `_referralFees` mapping so that both `extensions` and `signers` are added after all the occupied slots, avoiding storage corruption.
