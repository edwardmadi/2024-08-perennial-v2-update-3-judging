# Upgrade to v2.3 will revert due to incorrect initializer version in `OracleFactory`

**Summary**
`OracleFactory` is part of the v2.3 upgrade process. It should be re-initialized after upgrading the implementation (to store a newly introduced `OracleParameter` which was not present in previous implementation):
```solidity
    function initialize() external initializer(3) {
        // Re-initialize if owner is unset
        if (owner() == address(0)) __Factory__initialize();

        _parameter.store(OracleParameter(1, UFixed6Lib.ZERO, UFixed6Lib.ZERO));
    }
```

The issue is that initializer version used for new implementation is 3 - the same version as used in the previous initialization. This can be checked in live deployment events: https://arbiscan.io/address/0x8cda59615c993f925915d3eb4394badb3feef413#events (see the last `Initialized (uint256 version)` event parameter, which is `3`). The modifier will revert when the initializer version is the same as the one already used:
```solidity
    /// @dev Can only be called once per version, `version` is 1-indexed
    modifier initializer(uint256 version) {
        if (version == 0) revert InitializableZeroVersionError();
        if (_version.read() >= version) revert InitializableAlreadyInitializedError(version);
```

This means the whole upgrade process will fail, breaking contract core functionality (upgrade).

**Root Cause**
Incorrect initializer version:

**Internal pre-conditions**
None.

**External pre-conditions**
None.

**Attack Path**
The whole upgrade process will revert when trying to initialize `OracleFactory`

**Impact**
Core contract functionality (upgrade) broken

**PoC**
Not needed.

**Mitigation**
Use initializer version 4.
