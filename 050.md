# Critical Reentrancy Bug Allows Malicious Owners to Exploit and Deplete Collateral Funds

### Summary

A failure to properly manage collateral balances will cause a significant risk of fund loss for users as a malicious owner can exploit the system to withdraw more collateral than is actually available. By leveraging this vulnerability, the malicious actor can potentially deplete the account's funds, impacting the financial stability of users relying on this collateral.

### Root Cause

The choice to use the `wrapIfNecessary` function in the `Account.sol` contract without validating the outcome of the `wrap` operation is a critical design flaw. This oversight can result in the contract attempting to wrap an incorrect amount of USDC, potentially leading to unintended loss of funds.

In `perennial-v2/packages/perennial-account/contracts/Account.sol` at line [68](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-account/contracts/Account.sol#L68), the `wrapIfNecessary` function does not include a check to confirm the success or accuracy of the `wrap` function. Consequently, this lack of validation may cause the contract to wrap USDC when it is not necessary, risking the loss or mismanagement of assets.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Owner or Controller needs to call `marketTransfer` with a non-zero `amount` to trigger the `wrapIfNecessary` function.
2. The contract’s DSU balance needs to be less than the `amount` specified in `marketTransfer`, causing the contract to wrap USDC to DSU.
3. The `reserve` contract must be vulnerable to reentrancy attacks during the `wrap` operation, allowing an attacker to exploit the lack of reentrancy protection in the `wrap` function.

### External pre-conditions

1. The `reserve` contract must be deployed with a vulnerable implementation that lacks adequate reentrancy protection, enabling reentrancy attacks.
2. An attacker needs to be able to control or manipulate the `reserve` contract to exploit its vulnerability, potentially by executing malicious contracts or leveraging external dependencies that interact with the `reserve` contract.
3. The attacker must be able to perform multiple transactions quickly to exploit the reentrancy vulnerability effectively, taking advantage of timing and sequence to manipulate the `wrap` operation.

### Attack Path

1. **Attacker Deploys Contracts**: The attacker deploys the `ReentrancyAttack` contract and initializes it with the vulnerable `VulnerableAccount` and `MockReserve` contracts.

2. **Attacker Initiates Attack**: The attacker calls the `attack` function on the `ReentrancyAttack` contract, which triggers the `wrapIfNecessary` function in the `VulnerableAccount` contract.

3. **Trigger Wrap Function**: The `wrapIfNecessary` function in `VulnerableAccount` contract checks the USDC balance. Since it's less than the required amount, it calls the `wrap` function on the `MockReserve` contract.

4. **Reentrancy Attack**: The `wrap` function in the `MockReserve` contract does not include reentrancy protection. It triggers the fallback function in the `ReentrancyAttack` contract, which re-enters the `wrapIfNecessary` function in the `VulnerableAccount` contract.

5. **Repeat**: This process can repeat multiple times, as each reentry call continues to exploit the vulnerability, leading to a potential drain of funds.

6. **Withdrawal**: After exploiting the vulnerability, the attacker can call the `withdraw` function in the `ReentrancyAttack` contract to withdraw any stolen funds from the contract.

### Impact

The users of the `Account.sol` contract suffer an approximate loss of funds due to the incorrect amount of USDC being wrapped. The attacker could exploit the reentrancy vulnerability to repeatedly wrap and unwrap USDC, potentially causing the contract to mismanage its funds. This could lead to an unintended loss of funds for users as the contract might erroneously handle the wrapping operations.



### PoC

Assumptions for PoC:

1. The `Account` contract’s `wrapIfNecessary` function can be exploited to perform a reentrancy attack.
2. The vulnerable `Account` contract has a `wrap` function that interacts with an external contract, which could be manipulated by the attacker.

        }
    }

    function attack() public {
        // Start the attack by calling wrapIfNecessary
        vulnerableAccount.wrapIfNecessary(1 ether);

    function withdraw() public {
        // Withdraw any stolen funds

Explanation:

- MockReserve Contract: This simulates the `reserve` contract where the `wrap` function is called. It doesn't contain actual logic but represents an external contract that can be manipulated.
- VulnerableAccount Contract: This is a simplified version of the Account contract. It contains the `wrapIfNecessary` function that can be exploited.
- ReentrancyAttack Contract: This is the attacker's contract. It includes a fallback function to exploit reentrancy. When `wrapIfNecessary` is called, it triggers the fallback function to reenter and potentially exploit the vulnerability.


### Mitigation

1. Use a Reentrancy Guard: 
Introduce a reentrancy guard modifier to prevent reentrant calls to critical functions. This ensures that the function cannot be re-entered before its execution is complete.
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract Account is ReentrancyGuard {
    // Other code

    function wrapIfNecessary(UFixed18 amount, bool wrapAll) public nonReentrant ownerOrController {
        if (DSU.balanceOf().lt(amount)) {
            UFixed6 usdcBalance = USDC.balanceOf();
            if (!usdcBalance.eq(UFixed6Lib.ZERO))
                wrap(wrapAll ? UFixed18Lib.from(usdcBalance) : amount);
        }
    }

    // Other code
}
```

2. Update State Before External Calls:
Ensure that any state updates (such as balance changes) are made before calling external contracts. This reduces the chance of reentrancy attacks by updating internal states before interacting with external contracts.
```solidity
function wrapIfNecessary(UFixed18 amount, bool wrapAll) public ownerOrController {
    if (DSU.balanceOf().lt(amount)) {
        UFixed6 usdcBalance = USDC.balanceOf();
        // Update state or perform internal logic before calling external contracts
        if (!usdcBalance.eq(UFixed6Lib.ZERO))
            wrap(wrapAll ? UFixed18Lib.from(usdcBalance) : amount);
    }
}
```

3. Limit External Calls:
Minimize the use of external contract calls within functions that modify state. This reduces the attack surface for reentrancy attacks.
```solidity
function wrap(UFixed18 amount) public ownerOrController {
    // Wrap USDC to DSU using reserve contract
    reserve.mint(amount);
}
```

4. Perform Checks After External Calls: 
Validate results of external calls where possible, ensuring that the state is as expected after interactions with external contracts.
```solidity
function wrapIfNecessary(UFixed18 amount, bool wrapAll) public ownerOrController {
    if (DSU.balanceOf().lt(amount)) {
        UFixed6 usdcBalance = USDC.balanceOf();
        if (!usdcBalance.eq(UFixed6Lib.ZERO)) {
            wrap(wrapAll ? UFixed18Lib.from(usdcBalance) : amount);
            // Perform checks or validations here if needed
        }
    }
}
```

5. Implement a Withdraw Pattern: For functions involving financial transfers, use the “checks-effects-interactions” pattern to mitigate reentrancy. This involves checking conditions, updating the contract state, and then interacting with external contracts.
```solidity
function withdraw(UFixed6 amount, bool shouldUnwrap) external ownerOrController nonReentrant {
    UFixed6 usdcBalance = USDC.balanceOf();
    if (shouldUnwrap && usdcBalance.lt(amount)) {
        UFixed18 unwrapAmount = amount.eq(UFixed6Lib.MAX) ?
            DSU.balanceOf() :
            UFixed18Lib.from(amount.sub(usdcBalance)).min(DSU.balanceOf());
        unwrap(unwrapAmount);
    }
    UFixed6 pushAmount = amount.eq(UFixed6Lib.MAX) ? USDC.balanceOf() : amount;
    USDC.push(owner, pushAmount);
}
```
