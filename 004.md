# Zero Supply Division in DSU Redemption Price Calculation

## Summary
The `redeemPrice` function in the `ReserveBase` contract is vulnerable to a division by zero error when the total supply of DSU tokens is zero. This can lead to unexpected contract behavior or failure, disrupting the contract's ability to provide accurate redemption pricing.

## Vulnerability Detail
- Issue: The function calculates the redemption price by dividing the total assets by the total supply of DSU tokens (`dsu.totalSupply()`). If the total supply is zero, this division operation will result in a division by zero error. 
- Trigger Condition: This condition can occur if all DSU tokens have been redeemed or burned, reducing the total supply to zero.
```solidity
function redeemPrice() public view returns (UFixed18) {
@=> return assets().unsafeDiv(dsu.totalSupply()).min(UFixed18Lib.ONE);
}
```

## Impact
- The `redeemPrice` function will fail when called under zero supply conditions, returning an error instead of a valid price.
- Any contract logic or external systems that rely on the `redeemPrice` function for accurate pricing will be compromised, potentially leading to outages or incorrect financial calculations.
- Users attempting to redeem DSU tokens will encounter unexpected errors.
- The inability to accurately calculate the redemption price could lead to financial discrepancies or exploits in the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a check to ensure that `dsu.totalSupply()` is not zero before performing the division. If it is zero, the function should return a default value or handle the condition gracefully.
```diff
function redeemPrice() public view returns (UFixed18) {
+   uint256 totalSupply = dsu.totalSupply();
+   if (totalSupply == 0) {
+       return UFixed18Lib.ONE; // or another safe default value
    }
    return assets().unsafeDiv(totalSupply).min(UFixed18Lib.ONE);
}
```
