# settle() asyncFee is left in the KeepFactory and is not transfer to the keeper.

### Summary

After KeeperFactory.settle() executes successfully, `asyncFee` goes to the factory, not to `keeper`.

### Root Cause

in [KeeperFactory.sol:168](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/keeper/KeeperFactory.sol#L168)
After `keeper` executes the `settle()` method, the `asyncFee` is transferred from `KeeperOracle` to `KeeperFactory`.
But in the current code, `KeeperFactory` doesn't transfer this `fee` to `msg.sender` but leaves it in the contract and doesn't provide any method to do the transfer out
```solidity
abstract contract KeeperFactory is IKeeperFactory, Factory {
    function settle(bytes32[] memory oracleIds, uint256[] memory versions, uint256[] memory maxCounts) external {
...
        for (uint256 i; i < oracleIds.length; i++)
@>          IKeeperOracle(address(oracles[oracleIds[i]])).settle(versions[i], maxCounts[i]);
    }
```
```solidity
contract KeeperOracle is IKeeperOracle, Instance {

    function settle(uint256 version, uint256 maxCount) external onlyFactory {
        for (uint256 i; i < maxCount && callbacks.length() > 0; i++) {
            address account = callbacks.at(0);
            market.settle(account);
            callbacks.remove(account);
            emit CallbackFulfilled(SettlementCallback(market, account, version));

            // full settlement fee already cleamed in commit
            PriceResponse memory priceResponse = _responses[version].read();
@>          market.token().push(msg.sender, UFixed18Lib.from(priceResponse.asyncFee));
        }
    }
```


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `Keeper` call `KeeperFactory.settle()`

- token transfer from : keeperOracle.sol -> KeeperFactory.sol

2. token stay KeeperFactory.sol


### Impact

`asyncFee` is locked in the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
    function settle(bytes32[] memory oracleIds, uint256[] memory versions, uint256[] memory maxCounts) external {
        if (oracleIds.length == 0 || oracleIds.length != versions.length || oracleIds.length != maxCounts.length)
            revert KeeperFactoryInvalidSettleError();

        for (uint256 i; i < oracleIds.length; i++) 
+       {
+           Token18 rewardToken = IKeeperOracle(address(oracles[oracleIds[i]])).oracle().market().token();
+           UFixed18 balanceBefore = rewardToken.balanceOf();
            IKeeperOracle(address(oracles[oracleIds[i]])).settle(versions[i], maxCounts[i]);
+           rewardToken.push(msg.sender,rewardToken.balanceOf() - balanceBefore);
+      }
    }
```
