# effectiveAfter doesn't work as described

### Summary

effectiveAfter described as "The timestamp **at which** the current granularity setting becomes effective" but works as 
"The timestamp **after which** the current granularity setting becomes effective"

### Root Cause
In readme it states that invariants in natspec comments should hold
> Yes - function behavior is defined in the natspec comments and if they pose integration risk we would like to be aware of that.

```code
    /// @dev The timestamp at which the current granularity setting becomes effective
    uint256 effectiveAfter;
```
[types/KeeperOracleParameter.sol#L14](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-oracle/contracts/keeper/types/KeeperOracleParameter.sol#L14)

```solidity
    function current() public view returns (uint256) {
        KeeperOracleParameter memory keeperOracleParameter = _parameter.read();

        uint256 effectiveGranularity = block.timestamp <= keeperOracleParameter.effectiveAfter ? // @audit in @dev should be <
            keeperOracleParameter.latestGranularity :
            keeperOracleParameter.currentGranularity;

        return Math.ceilDiv(block.timestamp, effectiveGranularity) * effectiveGranularity;
    }

```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact
1. broken assumptions about function behavior

2. Oracle sometimes returns an incorrect timestamp. This could mean delayed liquidation events, missed trades, or inaccurate margin calls, especially in high-volatility environments

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
  function current() public view returns (uint256) {
      KeeperOracleParameter memory keeperOracleParameter = _parameter.read();

-       uint256 effectiveGranularity = block.timestamp <= keeperOracleParameter.effectiveAfter ?
+       uint256 effectiveGranularity = block.timestamp < keeperOracleParameter.effectiveAfter ?
          keeperOracleParameter.latestGranularity :
          keeperOracleParameter.currentGranularity;

      return Math.ceilDiv(block.timestamp, effectiveGranularity) * effectiveGranularity;
  }

```
