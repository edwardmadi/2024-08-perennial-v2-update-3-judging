# Market coordinator can set `staleAfter` to a huge value allowing anyone to steal all market collateral when there are no transactions for some time

**Summary**
The README states the following:
> Q: Please list any known issues and explicitly state the acceptable risks for each known issue.
Coordinators are given broad control over the parameters of the markets they coordinate. The protocol parameter is designed to prevent situations where parameters are set to malicious steal funds. If the coordinator can operate within the bounds of reasonable protocol parameters to negatively affect markets we would like to know about it

Market coordinator can set `staleAfter` risk parameter to any value (there is no validation at all). If set to a huge amount, he can steal all market collateral by abusing the price commited long time ago to open huge position which is already in bad debt using current price, when the current price is already very far away from the last commited price.

**Root Cause**
No `staleAfter` validation in `RiskParameter`:

**Internal pre-conditions**
- Malicious market coordinator

**External pre-conditions**
- Last commited price differs from current price by more than margin requirement

**Attack Path**
1. Coordinator opens huge long position + huge short position of the same size from 2 accounts (delta neutral portfolio)
...
2. Situation happens: no transactions for a long time and current price deviates away from last commited price by more than margin amount (such situation is very easily possible when the market is not super active, during quick price moves just a few minutes without transactions are enough for such price move).
3. Coordinator sets very large `staleAfter` value (e.g. `uint24.max`) and minimum `margin` and `maintenance` requirements
4. Coordinator withdraws max collateral from either long or short position (depending on whether current price is more or less than last commited price)
5. Next oracle version is commited (with current price), making the coordinator's position with collateral withdrawn go into bad debt.
6. Coordinator closes the other position, withdrawing all profit from it (collateral withdrawn from bad debt position + collateral withdrawn from closing the other position = initial collateral of both positions + bad debt)
7. The bad debt of the losing position is the profit of 2 combined positions, if positions are large enough, the bad debt will be greater than all market collateral, thus the user steals all of it.

If needed, the attack can be repeated until all market collateral is stolen.

**Impact**
All market collateral stolen. The severity is "High" even with market move pre-condition, because large `staleAfter` amount allows to wait enough time for the price to move away, and even in active live markets there are often large periods of inactivity (lack of market transactions and lack of new price commits since there are no requests).

**PoC**
Not needed.

**Mitigation**
Add sanity check for `staleAfter` risk parameter.
