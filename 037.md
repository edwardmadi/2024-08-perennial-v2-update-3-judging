# Vault.sol when market closed,  minPosition is calculated incorrectly, which may cause allocated assets to remain unreleased

### Summary

The `Vault.sol` calculation of `minPosition` doesn't take into account market closed, which can lead to values that are too large and funds never get released.

### Root Cause

in  [StrategyLib.sol#L205](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-08-perennial-v2-update-3/blob/main/perennial-v2/packages/perennial-vault/contracts/libs/StrategyLib.sol#L205)

We will calculate `marketContext.minPosition` to avoid `MarketOverCloseError/MarketInsufficientLiquidityError` error when decreasing `Position`

Use formula: `minPosition = user.maker - min( (global.maker - | global.long - global.short | ) , user.closable )`

The current code doesn't take into account market closed, which may result in `global.maker - | global.long - global.short | ` being very small, resulting in `minPosition` being too large.

note: when market closed , don't check MarketInsufficientLiquidityError

It should use : `minPosition = user.maker - user.closable` when the market closed.

```solidity
        marketContext.minPosition = marketContext.currentAccountPosition.maker
            .unsafeSub(marketContext.currentPosition.maker
                .unsafeSub(marketContext.currentPosition.skew().abs()).min(marketContext.closable));
```



### Internal pre-conditions

1. market.marketParameter.closed = true

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

`marketContext.minPosition` is too large will cause that can't reduce `position=0`, even if `weight=0`,  collateral can't be released, closed markets are not profitable, this part funds fails to generate revenue

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

when market closedï¼š`marketContext.minPosition = marketContext.currentAccountPosition.maker
            .unsafeSub(marketContext.closable);`
